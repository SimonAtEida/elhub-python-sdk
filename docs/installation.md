# Installation

## Stable release

To install ElHub Python SDK, run this command in your
terminal:

``` console
$ pip install elhub-python-sdk
```

This is the preferred method to install ElHub Python SDK, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for ElHub Python SDK can be downloaded from
the [Github repo][].

You can either clone the public repository:

``` console
$ git clone git://github.com/bkkas/elhub-python-sdk
```

Or download the [tarball][]:

``` console
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/bkkas/elhub-python-sdk/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

``` console
$ pip install .
```
